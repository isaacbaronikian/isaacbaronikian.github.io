# Isaac Baronikian

I am an Ottawa-based singer-songwriter and [mix engineer](https://isaacbaronikian.com/audio).

I run a [music blog](https://americanacheatsheet.com/) for my favourite tunes in the Indie-Folk/Americana/Singer-Songwriter scene.

Feel free to reach out via Instagram ([@isaacbaronikian](https://www.instagram.com/isaacbaronikian)) to say hello.
